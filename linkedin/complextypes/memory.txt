memory is allocated and deallocated automatically
the go runtime is statically linked
memory is managed in the runtime in dedicated threads.

using maps and key value pairs require proper memory allocation.
2 built-in functions: make() and new() for maps, slices and channels
new():
the new() fn allocates, but doesnt initialize memory.
when you allocate memory for a map: use new(), you will get back a memory address indicating the location of the map in memory, but map has zero memory storage.
if you try to add a key-value pair to the map, it will cause an error.
make():
both allocates and initalizes memory. you will get back memory address just like new() but storage is non-zero and ready to accept values. 

memory is deallocated by GC garbage collector. built for low latency.
objects out of scope or set to nil are eligible.
