#  Go Build Log 
Go learning log — code, concepts, and notes while developing backend &amp; systems expertise (one panic at a time).

This repository documents my journey learning **Go** with a strong focus on:
- data structures & algorithms  
- problem-solving patterns  
- writing efficient and readable Go code  
- building DSA intuition for backend engineering  

#### The goal is simple: **learn by solving, coding, and tracking progress.**

### 📂 Structure

This repo contains:
- Notes taken from Go LinkedIn course.
- Go implementations of DSA problems  
- `questions.txt` files with questions and detailed examples. 
- Pattern-based practice (two pointers, sliding window, stacks, etc.)  
- Time & space complexity analysis  
---
### 📈 Learning Approach
- Solve → implement in Go → analyze complexity → refactor
- Focus on patterns over memorizing solutions
- Today’s brute force is tomorrow’s optimized solution.
---
### ⭐ Why this repo exists
- As part of my transition into backend & systems engineering,
- I’m strengthening my DSA foundations using Go and documenting the process here.
